This file contains the things that needs to be checked before deploying the project

1. Make sure you have used airflow accessable paths while giving the file path.
2. In mysql stage, remove DROP TABLE command as we want the dataset to contain old records as well.
3. Make sure you have used today while accessing the files not a predefined date.
4. Update the yaml file to only include the things which are nesssecary.
